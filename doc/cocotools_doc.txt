CoCoTools is a package that facilitates interaction with the CoCoMac
database and analysis of downloaded data.  Because the server at
www.cocomac.org is slow and unreliable, it is recommended that users
of CoCoTools begin by populating a local sqlite database with query
results for all BrainMaps of interest.  The CoCoMac server returns
data in XML format.  Once stored locally, these XML files can be
retrieved very quickly for analysis.

>>> from cocotools.query import populate_database

When called with an iterable container of BrainMaps, or the path to a
file containing one BrainMap per line, populate_database queries
CoCoMac for Mapping and Connectivity data referring to these BrainMaps
and returns a dictionary detailing which queries failed.  (Failures
are most often due to the CoCoMac server hanging.)  When no argument
is supplied to populate_database, queries are performed for all
BrainMaps in CoCoMac.

>>> failed = populate_database(['PP99', 'PP02'])
Completed 1 map, 0 conn (2 maps requested)
Completed 1 map, 1 conn (2 maps requested)
Completed 2 map, 1 conn (2 maps requested)
Completed 2 map, 2 conn (2 maps requested)
Mapping queries failed for []
Connectivity queries failed for []
>>> failed
{'Connectivity': [], 'Mapping': []}

The sqlite database is kept in the subdirectory
".cache/py-string-funcs/" in the user's home directory.

>>> from os import listdir, environ
>>> listdir(environ['HOME']+'/.cache/py-string-funcs/')
['query_cocomac.sqlite']

With the database in place, analyses can be prepared.  The first step
is to transform the stored XML files into one or more NetworkX
graphs.

>>> from ...

Although graphs of the raw data can be subjected to direct analysis,
it is expected that users will want to condense the morasse of
incompatible statements that is CoCoMac into a summary connectivity
graph before attempting to draw conclusions about general macaque
neuroanatomy.  The Objective Relational Transformation (ORT) procedure
was designed for this purpose.  A full formal specification of ORT is
given in Stephan et al. (2000).

As preparation for ORT, a graph of the downloaded Mapping data is constructed.
