CoCoTools is a package that facilitates interaction with the CoCoMac
database and analysis of downloaded data.  Because the server at
www.cocomac.org is slow and unreliable, it is recommended that users
of CoCoTools begin by populating a local sqlite database with query
results for all BrainMaps of interest.

>>> from cocotools.query import populate_database

When called with an iterable container of BrainMaps, populate_database
queries CoCoMac for Mapping and Connectivity data referring to these
BrainMaps and returns a dictionary detailing which queries failed.
(Failures are most often due to the CoCoMac server hanging.)  When no
argument is supplied, queries are performed for all BrainMaps in
CoCoMac.

>>> failed = populate_database(['PP99', 'PP02'])
Completed 1 map, 0 conn (2 maps requested)
Completed 1 map, 1 conn (2 maps requested)
Completed 2 map, 1 conn (2 maps requested)
Completed 2 map, 2 conn (2 maps requested)
Mapping queries failed for []
Connectivity queries failed for []
>>> failed
{'Connectivity': [], 'Mapping': []}
