We have designed the **CoCoTools** project as a software library allow users of various interests and technical proficiencies to mine the CoCoMac database in its current form.

**CoCoTools** provides:
    
    1. Tols for querying the CoCoMac database (http://cocomac.org)
    2. A processing pipeline that performs operations neccessary for turning query results into connectivity matrices (graphs) suitable for analysis, plotting etc.
    3. Coodinate-free transformation algorithms that users to integrate connectivity from across the literature to form large-scale macro-connectomes.
    
       
**CoCoTools** was designed around the following the principles:

    1. To offer users as much control over data processing as they need:

        
    * a few simple high-level commands supplied with default options will produce results sufficient for most users
    * yet optional arguments can be supplied to most functions
    * source code is available and can be modified

    
    2. To not re-invent the wheel:

        
        * integrates with and borrows functionality from Python standard library allowing users to perform a multitude of functions from well maintained sources
        * depends on NumPy, matplotlib and NetworkX
