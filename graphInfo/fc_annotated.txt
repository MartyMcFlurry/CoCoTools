Notes:  - References are most recent papers in CoCoMac Literature output
- regions we don't want are commented out
- ones that need cleaning are preceded by $
- ones we're not sure about are preceded by ?
- NOTE: big prob. that cocomac doesn't include disjoint (or borders, so as not to include all other regions) as a relationship. say A is defined as a parent of B one time in 1905, and forever afterward the two are considered disjoint. cocomac will still regard B as within A. this is what happened with 8 and 45.
