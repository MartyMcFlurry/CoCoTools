      "The multi_map_ebunch function is designed to query the CoCoMac server for data from several parcellation schemes.  The first argument to the function is a string specifying whether mapping or connectivity information is desired.  The second argument, which is optional, specifies which brain maps should be queried; if no argument is given, data is sought for all brain maps in CoCoMac.  CoCoTools includes two constants that are useful second arguments to multi_map_ebunch: MAPPING_SOURCES is a list of those maps for which Mapping data have been entered into CoCoMac, and CONNECTIVITY_SOURCES is the corresponding list for maps with Connectivity data.\n",
