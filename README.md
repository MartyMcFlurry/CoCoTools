Installation instructions:
Installation of cocotools is not required to access the module.
However, if you do not install it, you can only access the cocotools' modules while your python session is inside the cocotools directory,
or you add cocotools to your PATH. We highly recommend you install cocotool, which makes this module available from any directory

On a non-windows system:
1) Open a terminal and cd to the cocotools directory with the setup.py in it. It is also where this README is.    
2) from the terminal type: python setup.py install
