      "The multi_map_ebunch function is designed to query the CoCoMac server for data from several parcellation schemes.  The first argument to the function is a string specifying whether mapping or connectivity information is desired.  The second argument, which is optional, specifies which brain maps should be queried; if no argument is given, data is sought for all brain maps in CoCoMac.  CoCoTools includes two constants that are useful second arguments to multi_map_ebunch: MAPPING_SOURCES is a list of those maps for which Mapping data have been entered into CoCoMac, and CONNECTIVITY_SOURCES is the corresponding list for maps with Connectivity data.",

In the tuple, the source area is listed first, and both areas are specified in full CoCoMac format.  A dictionary of edge attributes is the third entry in the tuple, with a PDC and an RC.  Numeric rather than alphabetic codes are used for PDCs in CoCoTools: Starting at zero, the numeric code refers to the index in the hierarchy recommended by Kotter & Wanke (2005) of the original alphabetic PDC.  An additional numeric code, 18, is included for CoCoMac data entries without a PDC.  In CoCoTools, lesser PDCs are valued more highly than greater ones.

Within a single map, the level of resolution with the most reported anatomical connections (in ConGraph) is kept.  In the event of a tie, the finer level of resolution is kept except in the case of the target map for ORT ('PHT00' below), for which the coarser level is kept.  This bias maximizes the translatability of information between maps during ORT.  When levels are discarded, areas are removed from both the MapGraph and its corresponding ConGraph, but, when possible, relational and connectivity information for the discarded levels are retained in the one that is kept."
